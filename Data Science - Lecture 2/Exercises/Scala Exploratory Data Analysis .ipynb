    "\n",
    "- `pulls_2011-2013.csv` contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.\n",
    "- `pulls_2014-2018.csv` contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.\n",
    "- `pull_files.csv` contains the files that were modified by each pull request."

A project that has a very small community might not be the best one to start working on. The small community might indicate a high barrier of entry. This can be caused by several factors, including a community that is reluctant to accept pull requests from \"outsiders,\" that the code base is hard to work with, etc. However, a large community can serve as an indicator that the project is regularly accepting pull requests from new contributors. Such a project would be a good place to start.\n",
    "In order to evaluate the dynamics of the community, we will plot a histogram of the number of pull requests submitted by each user. A distribution that shows that there are few people that only contribute a small number of pull requests can be used as in indicator that the project is not welcoming of new contributors."
