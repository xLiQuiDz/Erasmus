    "# EHB Data science - Exercice 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This first exercice session aims to introduce you to the Python ecosystem. Throughout this notebook, we will cover the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Markdown cells to structure your notebook;\n",
    "2. Introduction to Python variables and Python functions;\n",
    "3. Case study - Miles per Gallon.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lecture, you will be able to define python functions and variables, use python libraries and apply them in a real case study. You will also be able to enhance the visibility of your results using markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Using Markdowns\n",
    "\n",
    "In jupyter, there are 3 types of cells:\n",
    "1. **Raw**: allows you to store raw data, without \"pretty printing\" it.\n",
    "2. **Markdown**: allows you to write headers, subheaders, text, comments, etc.\n",
    "3. **Code**: contains the logic of your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can thus use Markdown syntax to structure your notebook. Use one or more **#**'s to create title, subtitles and so forth. Make sure to change the type of the cell from 'Code' to 'Markdown' in the menu bar (top right).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Italics and Bolt\n",
    "Using a underscores before and after a text, format the text as italic. Just like this, _This is in italics_. Using a double star before and after a text format the text as bolt. Just like this, **This is in bolt**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Lists\n",
    "Using hyphens, you can itemize or list text. Like this:\n",
    "- This is a list\n",
    "- of many\n",
    "- many\n",
    "- items\n",
    "\n",
    "or numbered like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is item 1\n",
    "2. This is the next item\n",
    "3. This is the last and final item\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Links\n",
    "You can also add links to this document:\n",
    "\n",
    "[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com \"Google's Homepage\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding pictures is also an option:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Python-logo-notext.svg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5. Code and Syntax Highlighting\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\n",
    "print s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6. Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Colons can be used to align columns. There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column1 | Column2 | Column3\n",
    "--- | --- | ---\n",
    "*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n",
